<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview</h2>
The objective of Assignment 1 is to evaluate your knowledge of the topics covered in Lectures 1-3. Topics include an overview of the E-Commerce system, common security attacks on E-Commerce websites, protecting E-commerce sites using well-known approaches, and some fundamentals of crypto protocols that are used for securing electronic commerce. Assignment 1 will focus on developing your abilities in identifying security flaws in an e-commerce website and securing the e-commerce application using some of the well-known approaches. Assignment 1 contains several problems related to the topics mentioned above. You are required to prepare the solutions with the description of the step-by-step processes as a single PDF or MS Word file and the necessary codes.

There are 4 (four) questions in Assignment-1. Q1 is related to different security attacks that can be performed on an e-commerce website. On the other hand, Q2 to Q4 are related to some of the popular protection methods that are used in e-commerce applications. Protection methods include Google‚Äôs ReCaptcha V2 and V3, email, multifactor authentication, and Google‚Äôs two-factor authentication (2FA) framework.

Develop the solution of this assignment in an iterative fashion (as opposed to completing it in one sitting). You should be able to start preparing your answers immediately after Lecture-1 (in Week-1). At the end of each week starting from Week-1 to Week-3, you should be able to solve at least one question.

If there are questions, you must ask via <strong>the relevant Canvas discussion forums </strong>in a general manner.

<strong>Overall, you must follow the following special instructions:</strong>

<ul>
<li>You must fulfill the requirements in the questions.</li>
<li>Create a group of a maximum of 2 people and perform the tasks as a group.</li>
<li>For the questions that require implementation, you must implement the functionalities stated in the questions. Any change in a user interface is acceptable if the functionality is there.</li>
<li>Your works <strong>must be demonstrated </strong>to your tutor. Date and time will be announced separately. <strong>No demo, no marks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You must submit the solutions as a report on CANVAS. </strong>In your solution, you must show all the steps with necessary code segments and screenshots for each question.</li>
<li>Upload your solution as a single PDF or Word document in CANVAS. Also, upload codes as a single ZIP file in the CANVAS.</li>
<li><strong>Do not put the PDF within the ZIP file.</strong></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment details</h2>
Please ensure that you have read <strong>Sections 1 </strong>to <strong>3 </strong>of this document before going further. Assessment details (i.e., questions Q1 to Q4) are provided on the <strong><u>next page</u></strong>.

<h2>Q1. Security Attacks on E-Commerce Websites (5 Marks)</h2>
In this assignment, you will perform an XSS and SQL Injection attack. You will learn to exploit these common web application vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts and manipulating database queries. By executing these attacks, you will gain insights into the potential risks and understand the importance of implementing effective preventive measures.

In Tutorial 1, you already taught how to run <strong>bWAPP </strong>from <strong>Docker Container</strong>. (Please refer to Tutorial 1 if you have not installed Docker and bWAPP)

In the <strong>login </strong>tab it will show you the login interface to the lab (see <strong>Figure-1.3:</strong>). Login with User: <strong>bee </strong>and Password: <strong>bug </strong>and change the difficulty to <strong>MEDIUM.</strong>

<h3>Figure-1.3: Login Page for the Lab</h3>
<strong>Figure-1.4 </strong>shows the main page of the bWAPP. On the right side, click on the dropdown menu under ‚ÄúChoose your bug‚Äù

<h3>Figure-1.4: bWAPP Lab interface</h3>
<strong>Figure-1.5 </strong><strong>show you the list of attacks that you can do for this assignment</strong>. Each category of the attack will start with ‚Äú<strong>/A ‚Äì AttackLabName/</strong>‚Äù.

<h3>Figure-1.5: List of Possible Attack Lab</h3>
For this assignment, you need to perform <strong>2 Attacks in SQL Injections </strong>and <strong>2 Attacks in </strong><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) </strong>from the list shown in <strong>Figure-1.6 and Figure-1.7</strong>:

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQL Injections Lab List (Under /A1 ‚Äì Injection/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XSS Lab List (Under /A3 ‚Äì Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)/)</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure-1.6: List of SQL Attack Lab&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure-1.7: List of XSS Attack Lab</h4>
Once you have selected the attack, click the ‚Äúhack‚Äù button next to the list of the attack (see Fig. 1.8).

<h4>Figure-1.8: Hack Button</h4>
<strong>To complete the requirements of this task, your group are required to perform the attacks on the given lab categories using the knowledge you have learned from <u>Tutorial 2</u>. For each of the attacks, write down all the necessary steps to launch each attack with screenshots.</strong>

<strong>What is considered a successful attack?</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>XSS: Successfully displaying any pop-up or alert on the webpage.</strong></li>
<li><strong>SQL Injection: Successfully gaining access by logging in, displaying credentials, or revealing the database version.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Q2. Securing E-Commerce Website from Spam and Abuse (2+4 = 6 Marks)</h2>
Create an E-Commerce application shown in <strong>Figure-2.1</strong>. Only registered users should be authorized to log in to the E-commerce application and trade. A registered user can be either a seller or a buyer who needs to create a user account. It is possible that several fake users are created by human attackers or software bots to hamper the operation of the E-Commerce application. To protect the E-Commerce application from spam and abuse, Alice requests you to integrate CAPTCHA into her E-Commerce application.

Considering the security strength of Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA </strong>service, you have decided to integrate it in Alice‚Äôs application.

<ol>
<li>a) From the knowledge you have learned in the Tutorial, implement Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA version 2:</strong></li>
<li>Design a form similar to the one given in <strong>Figure-2.1 </strong>to create a user account with Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA version 2</strong>. ii. Show step-by-step processes, with appropriate code segments and screenshots, how Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA version 2 </strong>can be applied in the E-Commerce application to prevent creating fake user accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Figure-2.1: Expected User Registration Page enabled with Google‚Äôs reCAPTCHA version 2</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>b) You have found that Google has a new version of its reCAPTCHA, which is <strong>reCAPTCHA version 3</strong>. When you informed Alice about the <strong>reCAPTCHA version 3</strong>, she was convinced that reCAPTCHA version 3 is better.</li>
</ol>
To make Alice happy:

<ol start="2">
<li>Design a form similar to the one shown in <strong>Figure-2.2 </strong>to create user accounts with Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA version 3</strong>.</li>
<li>Show step-by-step processes, with appropriate code segments and screenshots, how Google‚Äôs <strong>reCAPTCHA version 3 </strong>can be applied in the E-Commerce application to prevent creating fake user accounts. iii. What are the advantages of using <strong>reCAPTCHA version 3</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Figure-2.2: User Registration Page enabled with Google‚Äôs reCAPTCHA version 3</strong>

<h2>Q3. Simple Multi-Factor Authentication (4 Marks)</h2>
Once user accounts have been created, only valid users should be allowed to log in and trade using Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application. However, attackers can still compromise the login system with the aid of some sophisticated software. So, you have decided to integrate the <strong>multi-factor authentication </strong>in Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application.

Develop an <strong>Email-based multi-factor authentication </strong>for Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application that has the following requirements.

<strong><u>Requirements:</u></strong>

<ol start="3">
<li>Create a simple login form, as shown in <strong>Figure-3.1</strong>. The ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù field should only accept text in email format, and the ‚ÄúPassword‚Äù field should be in password format. When a user provides a valid email (your RMIT student email) and password (e.g., 1234), the user should receive a <strong>6-digit </strong>random number in his/her email address as shown in <strong>Figure-3.2 </strong>and the page to be shown as presented in <strong>Figure-3.3.</strong></li>
<li>Once the verification code is provided in the form shown in <strong>Figure-3.3</strong>, the code should be verified, and the <strong>Success Page </strong>is shown (see <strong>Figure-3.4</strong>). Otherwise, the <strong>Failure Page </strong>is shown (see <strong>Figure-3.5</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<strong>Figure-3.1: Login Form for Email-based Two Factor Authentication</strong>

<h3>Figure-3.3: Form to Enter the Verification Code</h3>
<strong>Figure-3.4: Success Page shown if a valid code is entered.</strong>

<strong>Figure-3.5: Failure Page shown if an invalid code is entered.</strong>

<h2>Q4. Advanced Multi-Factor Authentication (10 Marks)</h2>
Once user accounts have been created, only valid users should be allowed to log in and trade using Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application. However, attackers can still compromise the login system by performing a password-guessing attack. To prevent an attacker from getting access to the application by simply knowing the password, you have decided to integrate the <strong>multi-factor authentication </strong>in Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application.

Apply <strong>Google‚Äôs 2-step verification </strong>(e.g.2FA, also called <strong>2 Factor Authentication </strong>or <strong>2FA</strong>) to user accounts of the E-Commerce application. You need to perform the followings:

<ol start="4">
<li>Create a <strong>login form </strong>(as shown in <strong>Figure-4.1</strong>) that would allow you to enter your Email and password. The ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù field should only accept text in email format, and the ‚ÄúPassword‚Äù field should be in password format. Next, provide steps with the necessary code segment and screenshots of how you have integrated Goggle‚Äôs <strong>2FA </strong>in Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Figure-4.1: Login Form with Google‚Äôs 2-Factor Authentication</strong>

<ol start="4">
<li>Once a user enters the correct email and password, a screen (like <strong>Figure-4.2 or 4.3</strong>) should prompt the user to enter a 2-step verification code as follows:</li>
</ol>
<strong>Figure-4.2: Google‚Äôs Form to enter verification code in Google‚Äôs 2 Factor Authentication</strong>

<h3>Figure-4.3: Another Google‚Äôs Form to enter verification code in Google‚Äôs 2 Factor Authentication</h3>
<strong>Extra Question for Learning purpose only (<u>This question will not be assessed</u></strong>

Design an <strong>SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) </strong>framework and show step-by-step process to implement it in Alice‚Äôs E-Commerce application. In your designed 2FA framework, the E-commerce website should send an SMS to the verified user‚Äôs mobile phone number each time a user provides a valid username and password. The verification code should be a unique short-lived code. <strong>Figure-4.4 </strong>shows an overview of the system. Show steps with necessary code segments and screenshots.
